# Procedural Character Generation in Unity

This project focuses on the development of a **Procedural Character Generation System** using the Unity engine. It demonstrates the use of procedural content generation (PCG) techniques to dynamically create diverse characters with unique appearances, backstories, and attributes for a 2D gaming environment. 

## Overview

The project leverages the power of **Unity's 2D capabilities** and **C# scripting** to generate character designs that blend algorithmic randomness with narrative coherence. Each character is procedurally generated to have:

- A unique visual design.
- Distinct backstories.
- Specific gameplay-related attributes.

This approach enhances the depth of the game world, providing players with a richer and more engaging experience.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Character Creation**:
   - Characters with unique physical appearances.
   - Randomly generated backstories and attributes that influence gameplay.

2. **Fantasy-Themed Setting**:
   - Inspired by classic fantasy games and literature, including diverse races, magical abilities, and richly detailed narratives.

3. **Scalable System**:
   - Easily extensible to accommodate new features, character classes, and narrative elements.

4. **Integrated Tools**:
   - **Unity Sprite Editor** for detailed character sprites.
   - **C# scripting** to manage procedural algorithms.
   - **Unity Physics 2D** for realistic interactions.

## System Design

The character generation system comprises the following components:

- **Procedural Algorithms**: Scripts to create characters by combining various visual and narrative elements.
- **Backstory Generator**: Generates unique histories for characters, enhancing immersion.
- **Attribute Assignments**: Assigns gameplay traits such as strength, agility, or magical ability, affecting in-game mechanics.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive buttons and menus to interact with the generation system.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity Engine**: Primary development platform.
- **C#**: For scripting and algorithm development.
- **Physics 2D**: To enhance realism in character movement.
- **Animator Tool**: For character animations.

## Implementation Highlights

1. Transition from 3D to 2D:
   - Initial challenges with 3D modeling led to a pivot towards 2D character generation for efficiency and accessibility.

2. Algorithm Design:
   - Carefully crafted algorithms ensure a balance between randomness and narrative coherence.

3. Game Narrative Integration:
   - Characters' attributes influence their role and behavior in the game environment, integrating seamlessly with the overarching narrative.

## Future Scope

- Expand the procedural generation framework to include player customization options.
- Introduce advanced narrative coherence mechanisms.
- Extend the system to support 3D character generation as an optional module.

## Acknowledgements

This project draws inspiration from advancements in procedural content generation techniques and classic game titles that have utilized PCG effectively. It is a testament to the versatility of Unity and the creative possibilities of procedural generation in game design.
