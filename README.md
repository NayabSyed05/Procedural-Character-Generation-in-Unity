# Procedural-Character-Generation-in-Unity 

## Overview  
This project demonstrates a procedural character generation system developed using Unity for 2D gaming environments. It generates unique characters with diverse attributes, backstories, and appearances, blending algorithmic randomness with narrative coherence to create immersive gaming experiences.  

## Features  
- **Character Diversity**: Generates visually distinct characters with customizable classes (e.g., Archer, Knight, Mage).  
- **Unique Backstories**: Each character is assigned a procedurally generated backstory tailored to their attributes.  
- **Attribute Randomization**: Core attributes like strength, agility, and intelligence are randomized within logical boundaries.  
- **Game Integration**: Seamlessly integrates generated characters into gameplay.  

## Technologies Used  
- Unity (2D game development)  
- C# (Procedural algorithms and gameplay scripting)  
- Sprite Editor (Character visuals and animations)  

## How It Works  
1. **Class Selection**: Choose a character class using the dropdown menu.  
2. **Generate Attributes**: Randomize core stats like agility, strength, and intelligence.  
3. **Generate Backstory**: Add depth to your character with a procedurally generated narrative.  
4. **Integration**: Transition directly into gameplay with your custom character.
